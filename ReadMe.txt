Table Juicer
============

Squeeze the data you want out of your tables!

Table Juicer will be a light-weight application for viewing, browsing, sorting, and rearranging any data in table format.  The goal of the project will be to create a GUI application with the following features:

* provide a simple user interface for manipulating existing tabular data
* basic editing of tabular data
* fast searching/filtering of rows that hides non-matching rows in the current window
* support for regular expressions in search/filter fields 
* read and write text files in tabular format whether tab-delimited, comma-separated, or using arbitrary delimiters
* conversion of other formatted data (e.g. mailing lists) into tabular format?
* cross-platform support for any desktop OS with a Java 8 or later runtime
* decent integration with native MacOS, Windows, and Linux environments
* launch quickly and not be too resource hungry (as much as possible with Java)

STATUS:  Very early.  Can open tab-delimited files and display tables with columns that can be sorted & rearranged.  Table cells can be edited.

Table Juicer uses the JavaFX application framework and most of the basic table functionality is supplied by the JavaFX TableView class.
